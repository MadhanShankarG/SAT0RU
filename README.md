## Description
SAT0RU is a real-time cursed technique visualizer inspired by **Jujutsu Kaisen 呪術廻戦**.

It combines **MediaPipe hand tracking** with **Three.js particle systems** to recreate iconic cursed techniques using cinematic visual effects.

Hand gestures are translated into high-energy particle simulations, domain expansions, and spatial distortions in real time.

Powered by **Gemini 3**.

## Features

This project uses particle-based volumetric rendering to visualize cursed techniques:

### Secret Technique: Hollow Purple
**Visuals:** A chaotic singularity merging attraction and repulsion forces.  
**Trigger:** Pinch gesture (thumb + index finger touching).

### Domain Expansion: Infinite Void
**Visuals:** A layered celestial domain featuring an event-horizon ring, vertical information streams, and a deep cosmic field.  
**Trigger:** Cross gesture (index + middle fingers crossed).

### Cursed Technique Reversal: Red
**Visuals:** A white-hot core emitting a violent sphere of repulsive force.  
**Trigger:** Index finger pointing upward.

### Domain Expansion: Malevolent Shrine
**Visuals:** A dark, oppressive aura representing the King of Curses.  
**Trigger:** Flat hand / prayer gesture.

### Divine General Mahoraga
**Visuals:** The Eight-Handled Wheel manifests above the user, rotating slowly as shadows expand and darken the environment. A shadow pool spreads beneath, simulating adaptation energy and overwhelming presence.  
**Trigger:** Both hands clenched into fists and held steady.
